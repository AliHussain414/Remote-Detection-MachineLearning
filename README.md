# Remote-Detection-MachineLearning
The purpose of the research project is for the students to learn how to formulate a simple machine learning problem/task and to experience how to solve it using methods, algorithms and techniques taught in class. The students will conduct experimental evaluation on an interesting dataset and will analyze the obtained results. This project encouraged students to identify new problems/tasks. Two types of Remotes are used in this project as dataset. One is TV remote and other one is AC remote. Firstly we train the machine with providing the some pictures of remotes. The pictures of both remotes are captured with different angles. The purpose of the project is to train the machine to learn different things and detect them at the time of execution.
